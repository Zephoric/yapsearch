# YapSearch Global Prompt for Bolt.new

You are developing an enhanced version of YapSearch, a sophisticated chat AI research application that combines conversational AI with powerful research capabilities. Your task is to transform this application into a visually stunning, highly functional tool that helps users conduct research through natural conversation.

## Application Vision

YapSearch serves as an intelligent research assistant that enables users to explore topics, gather information, and synthesize findings through a conversational interface. The application should feel like interacting with a knowledgeable research partner who not only retrieves information but also helps organize, analyze, and present it in useful ways.

The enhanced YapSearch should embody these core principles:

1. **Intuitive Research Flow**: The conversation should naturally guide users through their research journey, from initial queries to refined results and synthesized conclusions.

2. **Visual Clarity**: Information should be presented in a visually appealing, well-organized manner that highlights important findings and makes complex information digestible.

3. **Contextual Intelligence**: The application should maintain context throughout the research process, building upon previous exchanges and refining understanding over time.

4. **Productivity Enhancement**: Features should be designed to save time, reduce cognitive load, and help users accomplish their research goals more efficiently than traditional search methods.

## Design Philosophy

The UI design should follow these guiding principles:

1. **Clean and Focused**: Minimize visual clutter while maximizing information density. Each element should serve a clear purpose in the research workflow.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features should be revealed progressively as needed, keeping the initial interface simple while allowing for depth.

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Establish clear visual relationships between different types of information (user queries, AI responses, search results, citations, etc.) through consistent use of color, typography, spacing, and visual elements.

4. **Responsive Fluidity**: The interface should adapt seamlessly across device sizes without compromising functionality or visual appeal.

5. **Delightful Interactions**: Incorporate subtle animations, transitions, and micro-interactions that make the application feel responsive and engaging without being distracting.

## Conversation Experience

The chat experience should be reimagined to support research activities:

1. **Message Differentiation**: User messages and AI responses should be visually distinct, with additional visual cues for different types of AI responses (direct answers, search results, reasoning, suggestions).

2. **Research Context**: The conversation should maintain and display relevant context, including the current research topic, key findings so far, and potential next directions.

3. **Information Visualization**: Where appropriate, information should be presented in visual formats (charts, tables, cards) rather than plain text to improve comprehension and retention.

4. **Source Transparency**: Search results and citations should be clearly attributed with visual indicators of source credibility and relevance.

5. **Interactive Elements**: Messages should contain interactive elements where appropriate, such as expandable sections for detailed reasoning, clickable citations, and actionable suggestions.

## Technical Implementation

When implementing the enhanced YapSearch:

1. **Component Architecture**: Design a modular component system that allows for consistent styling and behavior across the application while enabling easy updates and extensions.

2. **State Management**: Implement robust state management to handle complex conversation flows, search results, user preferences, and application settings.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the application remains responsive even with long conversations and rich media content through techniques like virtualization, lazy loading, and efficient rendering.

4. **Accessibility**: Build accessibility into the core design, ensuring the application is usable by people with diverse abilities and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling and recovery mechanisms to maintain a smooth user experience even when issues occur.

## User-Centered Features

The enhanced application should include these user-centered features:

1. **Personalization**: Allow users to customize the interface, save preferences, and receive personalized research suggestions based on their history and behavior.

2. **Research Organization**: Provide tools for organizing research findings, including conversation categorization, tagging, and search within past conversations.

3. **Export and Sharing**: Enable users to export research findings in various formats (PDF, Markdown, etc.) and share insights with others through direct links or collaboration features.

4. **Continuous Learning**: Design the system to learn from user interactions, improving suggestion quality and search relevance over time.

5. **Contextual Help**: Integrate subtle guidance and tooltips to help users discover and utilize the full capabilities of the application.

## Implementation Approach

When building this enhanced version of YapSearch:

1. Start with the core conversation experience, ensuring the fundamental research flow is intuitive and effective.

2. Implement the visual design system, establishing consistent patterns for all UI elements.

3. Add advanced features progressively, testing each addition with the core research use cases.

4. Optimize for performance and accessibility throughout the development process.

5. Gather feedback on the user experience and iterate on the design to address pain points and enhance successful features.

By following this global prompt, you will create a version of YapSearch that not only looks beautiful but fundamentally transforms how users conduct research through conversation, making the process more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable.
