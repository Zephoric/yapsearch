YapSearch UI Improvement and Chat AI Research Enhancement Project Prompt
Project Overview
Create an enhanced version of the YapSearch chat AI research application with a modern, intuitive UI and improved research capabilities. The current application provides basic chat functionality with AI-powered research features, but requires significant UI/UX improvements and functional enhancements to deliver a more engaging and productive user experience.
Current Application Analysis
The existing YapSearch application is built with Next.js 14 App Router and uses React with TailwindCSS for styling. It implements a chat interface that allows users to interact with AI for research purposes. The application currently features:
A basic chat interface with message history
AI-powered responses with reasoning capabilities
Search result integration within the chat flow
Several suggestion types (Podcast Outline, YouTube Video Research, Short Form Hook Ideas, Newsletter Draft)
A simple top navigation bar with minimal styling
The application structure follows Next.js conventions with a main page component handling most of the chat logic and state management. The UI is functional but lacks visual appeal, intuitive navigation, and advanced features that would enhance the research experience.
Desired Improvements
UI Enhancements
Transform the user interface to create a more engaging, professional, and intuitive experience:
Implement a modern, visually appealing design system with consistent color schemes, typography, and component styling that follows current design trends while maintaining excellent readability and accessibility.
Redesign the chat interface to include:
Clear visual distinction between user messages and AI responses
Better visualization of search results with previews and thumbnails
Improved message threading and conversation organization
Expandable/collapsible sections for reasoning and search results
Visual indicators for loading states (thinking, searching, etc.)
Create a responsive sidebar navigation that provides:
Chat history/saved conversations
Research categories and filters
User settings and preferences
Quick access to suggestion templates
Design a more interactive top bar with:
Search functionality
User profile/settings access
Help/documentation
Share/export options for research results
Implement dark/light mode toggle with smooth transitions and proper color management
Functional Enhancements
Improve the research capabilities and overall functionality:
Enhance the AI research workflow by:
Adding the ability to refine search queries during a conversation
Implementing source citation and credibility indicators
Creating visual summaries of research findings (charts, tables, etc.)
Allowing users to bookmark or save important information within a chat
Implement advanced chat features:
Message editing and deletion
Conversation branching to explore different research paths
Conversation summarization and key points extraction
File attachment and image analysis capabilities
Add productivity tools:
Export options (PDF, Markdown, etc.) for research results
Scheduling for follow-up research
Integration with note-taking applications
Collaboration features for team research
Improve suggestion system:
Expand suggestion types based on user needs
Create customizable templates for different research scenarios
Implement a learning system that improves suggestions based on user behavior
Technical Requirements
Maintain the existing Next.js 14 App Router architecture
Continue using React and TailwindCSS for frontend development
Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
Implement proper state management for complex UI interactions
Optimize performance for quick loading and smooth interactions
Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
Deliverables
Complete UI redesign with all specified enhancements
Functional prototype with improved research capabilities
Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
Documentation for new features and components
Design system documentation for future extensions
This project aims to transform YapSearch from a basic chat research tool into a comprehensive, visually appealing, and highly functional research assistant that enhances productivity and delivers superior user experience.
